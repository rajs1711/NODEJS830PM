#  Dependencies and DevDependencies :

difference between both is -
if  the package is required only during the development of
your project not in production in that case we install
packages under DevDependencies.
for example:
 nodemon package: this package helps to restart your server
 whenever your save your file , so this is the requirment which
 needs during development only , that;s why we have to install
 this package under DevDependencies.

  npm i nodemon --save-dev
