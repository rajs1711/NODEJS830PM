===============================================
src = >(source folder)
this is the folder where we create subfloders and files for our application

App.css => this file helps to write css for your application in class or id level 
index.css => this file helps to write css for global configuration like element level on your application

====================
.jsx ( javascript extensions):

JSX stands for javscript XML (extensible markup language). It is a sysntex extension for javascript 
thet allows you to write HTML like code directly within JS.

Example:
const welcome_message=<h1>Hello i am jsx </h1> 

Note: It helps to emebed variables of javascript with html .
by using {}. This enable dynamic content rednering and logic in jsx .

example:
const name='raj';
const element= <h1>Hello {name}</h1>
   //output: Hello name

Component Creation and call 
==================================
Component:
In React js Components are the building blocks that allow you to split the UI into 
independent and reusable pices.
  OR 
A component in react js is a javascript function or class  that optionally
accept s props and returns a react element  that describe 
how a section of the UI should appear.

Types: 1. Functional component 2. class component

======================================
Props: Props is a property of component which can be passed from one
component to another component.
It is a away to transfer data from one component to another component. 

We can pass props from parent component to child component. 
Note: To recive data from child to parent component we can use the concept function props .

1. parent component:  Parent component is a component where the 
another component render .
2. Child component: Let say we have product component (product.jsx)  and we want to render this
product into component home.jsx  so in that case . 
product is child component .

Note: with the help of props we can trasnfer data like :
     variable ,object ,functions ,arrays,string,state

EVENTS:
Events is react is similar to javascript but with some minor change.
For example:
commonly used events :
1. Form Event: onChange , onSubmit
2. Keyboard Event:onKeyUp,onKeyDown,onKeyPress 
3. Focus Event : onFocus , onBlur 
4. button: onClick ,onDoubleClick


Hooks:
Hooks in React js are a way to use state and other react feature in Functional
components. Introduced in react 16.8 version .

there are several types of hooks 
for example:
useState, use Effect,useContext,useMemo ....

useState: This hook helps to make our vriable in react mutable . In
react by default the variables are immutable but by using the concept 
of hook(useState) we make our variable immutable means we can change the value of variable.
